                        Hot sun beating down
                        Burning my feet just walking around
                        Hot sun makin' me sweat
                        Gators getting close, hasn't got me yet
                        I can't dance
                        I can't talk
                        Only thing about me is the way I walk
                        I can't dance
                        I can't sing
                        I'm just standing here selling everything
                        Blue jeans sittin' on the beach
                        Her dog's talking to me, but she's out of reach
                        Mhm, she's got a body under that shirt
                        But all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt
                        'Cause I can't dance
                        I can't talk
                        Only thing about me is the way I walk
                        I can't dance
                        I can't sing
                        I'm just standing here sellin'
                        Oh and checking everything is in place
                        You never know who's lookin' on
                        Young punk spillin' beer on my shoes
                        Fat guy's talkin' to me tryin' to steal my blues
                        Thick smoke, see her smiling through
                        I never thought so much…
